This is the code for count-based and neural language models.
There are two main-files: the HW3.lua file is for code that runs on the GPU and does not contain the count-based models. The Hw-no-cuda has all the models but no full support for the GPU. 

the batch_learn.sh script can be called from the cluster in order to submit a job that trains the model and predicts scores on the test set.

preprocess.py takes the training data and preprocesses it into a sparse format.

csvformat.py takes the predictions and tranforms them into a kaggle-readable format.
